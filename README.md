# get_title.sh

A zsh shell script which takes one URL as input and outputs the title of that page.

Uses Growl (via [growlnotify](http://growl.info/downloads#generaldownloads), if installed) to alert user of progress.

Uses [titlecase](https://github.com/ap/titlecase/), if installed, to format the output.

See comments inline for more information.
